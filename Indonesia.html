    <h3>Government</h3>
    
    <p>The government of Indonesia is pretty normal in my opinion. It is made up of three branches- the Executive branch, the Judicial branch, and the Legislative brach. Just some pretty easy facts!</p>
    
    <h3>Military</h3>
    
    <p>Indonesia has a military just like any other country.Also, this includes the Navy, Armed Forces, and the Air Force. By the way, the President of Indonesia is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces! Pretty neat!</p>
