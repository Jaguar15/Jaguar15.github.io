  <p> We all love video games. Whether it's the story or playing with friends, it's fun. So, my goal is to maximize your gaming experience.</p>
            
  <p>First, I would recommend buying a gaming chair. Or at least have a dedicated chair that you will play on. This way you will never experience the discomfort of the floor or a wooden chair.</p>

  <p>Next, I would also recommend having a gaming headset. Something that is comfortable and something that you want to wear. Now, if you want like a headset with a brand it might be pretty pricy. However, if you want the ultimate gaming experience you must make sacrifices.</p>
              
  <p>Finally, I just would have one last thing is to just have fun, play what you like. Also, play with friends for even more laughter and good times.</p>

  <h2>Schedule</h2>
  <!--schedule information-->
  <p>This section is about mainly just time management. Like, when you should and should not play games. Some things are obvious, like not playing when you have homework. Or not playing if you are busy. So, of course just be responsible and do not make simple mistakes like not turning in your homework because you were playing with friends!</p>
